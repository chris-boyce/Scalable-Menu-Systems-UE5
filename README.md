Menu System Framework for Unreal Engine 5 using C++
Welcome to the educational framework tailored for Unreal Engine 5 using C++. This README provides an overview of the project, including the topics covered, objectives, and testing methodologies employed.

Topics Covered
Maps
Link Lists
Stacks
Queues
Templates
Try-Catch
Lambda Functions
Binary Trees

The project aims to investigate and construct an educational framework suited for Unreal Engine 5 development using the C++ programming language. It encompasses advanced programming concepts, including arrays, vectors, maps, binary trees, templates, smart pointers, try-catch, and lambda functions.

Initiative Details
Through meticulous research, each learning topic was comprehensively explored and seamlessly integrated into the framework. This resulted in a well-documented process and a clear outline for creating practical projects within the Unreal Engine environment. Additionally, the initiative includes the development of tutorials tailored to undergraduate audiences.

Testing Methods
To ensure the reliability and correctness of the framework, thorough testing methods, including both black-box and white-box testing, will be implemented across various components. These methods guarantee functionality and internal code accuracy, ensuring the framework's effectiveness in educational settings.

Thank you for exploring our educational framework. For further details and contributions, please refer to the project repository.
